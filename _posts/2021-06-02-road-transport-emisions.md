This map is based on the outputs of the `National Transport Authority of Ireland` (NTA) model, which was provided to `Codema - Dublin's Energy Agency` upon special request. 

> For illustrative purposes, values have been split into eight seperate equal portions, as per their carbon emissions, and a colour has been assigned to them accordingly. Individual road emisisons can be obtained by hovering over a specific location.
