A map of Medium Voltage (MV) substation clusters.  Created by grouping similarly located MV substations using data from the [ESB Substation Capacity
map](https://www.esbnetworks.ie/network-capacity-map)

> **Caveat:** the ESB substation capacities do not included contracted or bid capacity and so the indicative capacities
systematically underestimate availability. If these were included all zones other than Dun Laoghaire Rathdown would
likely be close to zero.
