This map of mean dwelling occupancy was created using the open-access Small-Area Population Statistics (SAPS) 2016, provided to `Codema - Dublin's Energy Agency` by the `Central Statistics Office (CSO)`. 

> Mean dwelling occupancy was calculated by dividing the total number of occupants per household (`"T6_3_TP" or "Total Persons"`) by the total number of dwellings (`"T6_3_TH" or "Total"`) in each Small Area. The colourbar legend represents the mean number of occupants per dwelling in each Small Area where red and green indicate a higher and lower number of occupants respectively.
