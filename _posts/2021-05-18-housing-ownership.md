This map of Housing Percentage Ownership  was created using the open-access Small-Area Population Statistics (SAPS) 2016, provided to `Codema - Dublin's Energy Agency` by the `Central Statistics Office (CSO)`. 

> Ownership was calculated by dividing the total number of dwellings owned with a mortgage (`T6_3_OMLH":"Owned with mortgage or loan"`), together with the dwellings owned outright (`T6_3_OOH":"Owned Outright"`) by the total number of dwellings (`"T6_3_TH":"Total"`).  The colourbar legend represents percentage ownership of the housing stock where red and green indicate a higher and lower ownership respectively.
