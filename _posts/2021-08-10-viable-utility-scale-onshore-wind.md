Displays areas suitable for utility scale wind under the specified constraints.  Created using data provided by `data.gov`:

- [mean-offshore-wind-speed-2003-height-75m-above-mean-sea-level](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/mean-offshore-wind-speed-2003-height-75m-above-mean-sea-level?package_type=dataset)

## Constraints

- Not within 5km of a large town or city - Dublin City Council administrative boundary taken as the city boundary, large town defined as town centres from the County Development Plan 2016 zoning maps
- Not within 2km of the perimeter of a small town - continuous and discontinuous urban fabric layers of high density were used to define the boundary of small town equivalent
- Not located in an environmentally sensitive area (e.g. SAC, SPA, NHA)
- Not located within woodland areas or within 200m of woodland areas
- Located in areas with optimal wind speeds (greater than 8m/s assuming a 75m hub height)
- Not within 500m of any residential area or within a minimum distance of four times the turbine height from any home - locations of individual homes were not known at the time of writing this report but potential to use the Councilâ€™s geodirectory data could be used to model this more accurately, if available.
